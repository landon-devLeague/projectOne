#Project name: Number guess
In this project we will be working with Python to better understand how: importing classes work, if else statements, while loops, and project flow control works. 

##Objective 
To create a working text based interactive number guessing game. 

##Prerequisites 
List of topics/concepts/projects/exercises to complete prior to doing this project. 
  - Basic knowledge of Python
  - IF else statements (spaces needed)
  - loops
  - flow control

##Requirements 
  - To complete this project you will need the following: 
  - Sublime Text 

##Desired Outcome List of outcomes 
####Ex: At the completion of this exercise, students should understand: 

		- How if else statements work
		- How While loops work 
		- What is flow control
		- Importing classes into python
    
##Your Challenge - Steps to create the project:
 
    - Create a `numberGuess.py` file.
    - In this file introduce the game with a simple greeting and overview of the rules
		- Import the random class to the python file 
		- Make a variable that will hold the userâ€™s guess
		- set the random numbers range
		- create a while loop to span the number of guesses you are allowing the user to find the number
		- using if else statements create the logic for finding the right numbers guess, with hints. Be sure to include a condition when/if the user does get the right number and also the condition if they don't get the number right.

##Resources 
 - List of resources where students can research on their own.

 - while loop: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_while_loop.htm
 - if/else: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_decision_making.htm


### Possible additions to project
  - increase range of random numbers. (1-50, 1-100...)
  - guess counter to let the user know how many guess are used/left
    </br>`this guess is too low`
    </br>vs</br>
    `this guess is to low
    </br>you have 3 guesses left`
    
    </br> Bigger topic to think of: what is more user friendly? How important is user interface/experience in a project?
    
    - Possibly talk about strategic guessing to find the right guess.
    - Possibly speak on the Big-O times averages on finding the right number based on guessing.
